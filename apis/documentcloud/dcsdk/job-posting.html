                <h2>Job Posting</h2>
                <p>Job postings are usually limited to text-based content, but often additional supporting documents, such as PDF brochures, can better communicate the opportunity or the company.
                </p>
                <p>Adobe Document Services allows job sites to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Show and render high-resolution supporting documents
                  </li>
                  <li>Access analytics to understand what documents candidates are most interested in
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition, Adobe Document Services allows for documents uploaded in different formats, such as Microsoft Word, to be normalized into the PDF format.</p>
                <h3>Relevant APIs</h3>
                <ul>

                <h3>Scenario</h3>
                <p>An HR manager logs into a job posting site.
