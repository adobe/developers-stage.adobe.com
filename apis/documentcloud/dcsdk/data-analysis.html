                <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
                <p>Many PDF documents contain reports, such as government reports, financial securities reports, or SEC filings. These reports are often made up of an array of pertinent, actionable information presented in many forms â€“ including text blocks, tables, figures, and charts. Packaged in their native PDF form, individual reports are optimized for human consumption. However, organizations want to accelerate the process of making this information readily available. The Adobe PDF Tools API can be used to export PDF documents into other formats, such as Microsoft Excel to facilitate analysis.</p>
                <p>Additionally, there are cases where hundreds or thousands of reports need to be analyzed in aggregate making it impractical for humans to do manually. The Adobe PDF Extract API enables the content published in reports, as well as other rich document types, to be extracted in context and efficiently analyzed by machine learning algorithms to expose new, deeper insights.</p>
                <h3>APIs Used</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Adobe PDF Tools API</li>

                <p>A company has several years of archived financial reports that have been saved in different formats. Some of the files are also paper documents, so data is difficult to use without significant manual intervention. Data analysts want to be able to select reports from a repository, no matter its original format, and analyze and perform calculations on them. After completing their analysis, they want to create new reports to share with executives in PDF format.</p>
